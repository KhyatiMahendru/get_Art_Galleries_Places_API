# get_Art_Galleries_Places_API
This script was developed by me for my Data Analytics Internship at CSIR-CDRI from December 2017 to July 2018.
This was created in an attempt to collect contact and location details for art galleries in a country, for multiple countries.
In this script, I have collected data for art galleries in Malta - which has six provinces. 
I have found through experiment that dividing a country into smaller units like states or provinces provide better and more complete results.
The Google Places API Web Service enforces a default limit of 1,000 free requests per 24 hour period.
You can increase this limit free of charge, up to 150,000 requests per 24 hour period, by enabling billing on the Google API Console to verify your identity.
Thus, if you want to use this script for collecting details about art galleries in a larger country, say USA with 50 states, you might need to divide the states further over days in the unbilled version.
